## Hi there 👋

- 👨‍💻 I work as a [software engineer, software consultant, and quality engineer](https://teamscale.com/publication-author/marcel-bruckner) at [CQSE GmbH](https://cqse.eu), where I focus on improving software quality through static analysis, code reviews, and tool development.
- 👨‍🎓 I successfully completed my master's degree in [Informatics: Games Engineering](https://www.tum.de/en/studies/degree-programs/detail/informatics-games-engineering-master-of-science-msc) with my [master's thesis](https://github.com/MarcelBruckner/Master-Thesis), written at the [Chair of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Real-Time Systems](https://www.in.tum.de/en/i06/home/). My thesis focused on **Vision-Based Continual Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Manipulation Tasks**, exploring how robots can continuously learn and adapt their actions using visual input.
- 🍸 On the weekends, you might find me at [Blitz Club](https://www.blitz.club/), either working or enjoying the music.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to **Computer Vision, Continual Learning, and Reinforcement Learning**, particularly in applications such as robotics, autonomous systems, and AI-driven simulations.
- 💬 Ask me about anything! I'm happy to discuss any topic, and even more so if I can help you with something.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can find my most important contact channels on my [Homepage](https://marcelbruckner.info).

## [TUM Projects](https://github.com/MarcelBruckner-TUMProjects)
This repository contains all projects I worked on during my studies at TUM as well as my thesis papers:

- **[Master's Thesis: Vision-Based Continual Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Manipulation Tasks](https://marcelbruckner.info/going/4?https://github.com/MarcelBruckner/Master-Thesis)**  
  - Focused on training robotic systems to improve their manipulation skills over time using computer vision and reinforcement learning.
  - Explored techniques for handling **non-stationary environments** and **lifelong learning** in AI systems.

- **[Bachelor's Thesis: Recognition of Generated Code in Open Source Software](https://marcelbruckner.info/going/21?https://github.com/MarcelBruckner/Bachelor-Thesis)**  
  - Developed methods to identify automatically generated code in large-scale open-source projects.
  - Investigated the implications of generated code for **software maintenance, security, and code analysis**.
